Linked in

Facebook groups. This is a gold mine, but does take a few months to build up your own group and following.
Quora spaces. Similar to Facebook, you can set up a space and just frequently post helpful content which should build up your followers list over time.
Betalist, Product Hunt, etc... All the free SaaS marketplaces.
Linkedin. Painfully slow, it's hard to get traction here but when you do convert - it's great leads nonetheless.
Write blog articles on popular platforms like Medium, substack, hashnode. Much easier to Rank high on Google here first. Just make sure you set the "canonical URL" to point to your domain.
